### Coding styles I used:

### What I learned
1. I learned about 'react-date-range' and how they have a DateRange component for selecting a range of dates. Similar functionality to the one Airbnb has. 
2. How using two width properties in CSS is right.
	At first knowledge I knew you only need one width property per selector but CSS is dynamic & flexible and using two widths with different percentages can help achieve targeted results.

	Notice how the content in the footer section without the width set to 1024px is overflowing beyond the viewpoint but with another width property set to 1024px value it's aligned perfectly.
